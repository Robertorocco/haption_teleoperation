# haption_teleoperation

Operator-side half of the TRIAGo shared-autonomy teleoperation system: it drives a
**Haption Desktop 6D Compact** haptic device and renders force feedback, while the sibling
package [`triago_control`](https://github.com/Robertorocco/triago_control) runs the
QP-CLF-CBF safety controller and the shared-autonomy inference stack on the robot side.
The two packages run together and communicate over live ROS 2 topics.

## Branches

- **`virtuose-6d-baseline`** — frozen checkpoint of every gain/parameter as tuned on the physical **Haption Virtuose 6D**. Full commit history back to project start is preserved here; never developed on directly. Diff against it to see exactly what a Desktop 6D Compact retune has changed, e.g. `git diff virtuose-6d-baseline -- scripts/teleop_triago_clutch.py`.
- **`main`** / **`feature/sim-user-study`** — active development: adapting to the new **Haption Desktop 6D Compact** (smaller footprint, same control API) plus simulation-only work for a human-subject user study. Both point to the same commit as `virtuose-6d-baseline`'s tip and diverge from here forward. Checked out in lockstep with `triago_control`'s branch of the same name for the study.

## Architecture

```

**Frame convention:** the Haption base frame and the TRIAGo base frame differ by a pure
180° rotation about Z (negate X and Y, keep Z). The same map carries motion commands
(device → robot) and rendered forces (robot → device).

## The 2×2×2 study matrix

The active experiment condition is selected **once**, in `triago_control`'s
`qp_controller/config.py` (section 1b), by three orthogonal flags:

- `CONTROL_MODE` ∈ {`CLUTCH`, `JOYSTICK`} — position vs velocity control;
- `ASSIST_FEEDBACK` — channel F: assistive guidance forces on the handle;
- `ASSIST_BLENDING` — channel B: reference-level user↔policy blending (robot side).

Every teleop and force-manager node validates the selected cell at startup and refuses
to run on a mismatch. The eight force managers are named `haptic_force_manager_<CELL>`,
where `<CELL>` = `C`/`J` (mode) + `F` if feedback + `B` if blending:

| Cell | Mode | Operator feels |
|---|---|---|
| `C`   | clutch   | EE sync tether + cues (baseline) |
| `CF`  | clutch   | tether + guidance bias |
| `CB`  | clutch   | tether (to the blended reference) |
| `CFB` | clutch   | tether + guidance bias, reference blended |
| `J`   | joystick | homing spring + cues (baseline) |
| `JF`  | joystick | spring + guidance bias |
| `JB`  | joystick | homing spring, reference blended |
| `JFB` | joystick | spring + guidance bias, reference blended |

## Build & run

```bash
cd ~/exchange/ros2-ws
colcon build --packages-select haption_teleoperation
source install/setup.bash

ros2 run haption_teleoperation virtuose_server_node

# pick the teleop + force-manager pair matching the condition in config.py, e.g.:
ros2 run haption_teleoperation teleop_triago_clutch.py
ros2 run haption_teleoperation haptic_force_manager_C.py

ros2 run haption_teleoperation virtuose_calibration     # joint-limit discovery
ros2 run haption_teleoperation haption_plotter.py       # debug plotting
```

The robot side (`main_qp_controller*.py`, `main_shared_autonomy.py`) must run from
`triago_control`; see that repo's README for the full launch sequence.
